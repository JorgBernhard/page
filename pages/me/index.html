        <span>Thats Me!<br><br>I'm 54 years old, born in Germany, studied administration and logistics.<br> I'm married and have a daughter, challenge my self every day as a cook, "it helps getting my mind off things".
            <br><br>UI/UX-Design.<br> I have very good skills, self-made, in web-design, over 3 years of teaching design in São Paulo. I created over 50 web-pages, logos, marketing templates and flyers.

Working as a consultant has increased my experience in developing business strategies to increase productivity, establishing balance between the company-areas and there teams. <br>Over the years I have developed a constantly growing knowledge of computer-science, build and set-up servers, and created wifi net-works.
